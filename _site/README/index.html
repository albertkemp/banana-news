<h1>Big updation feature with eleventy and nunjucks</h1>
<p>How to add a page:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go into _includes/base.njk and add a page inside the top nav bar in that file</li>
<li>Create your new page as a HTML page in the root folder (The top level of the Github repository)</li>
<li>If you need any CSS/JS, create a CSS/JS file in the styles/scripts folders and add the style link or script tag to _includes/base.njk</li>
<li>Only put the body content in the HTML page, with the thingy on top. You don't need head, html or body tags, or a footer or top navigation bar. Just your unique content. For example:
<code></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>layout: &quot;base.njk&quot;
title: &quot;Home&quot; (this is a comment: Notice that there is no - Banana News, that will be automatically handled)</h2>
<p>Your stuff here:
e.g.
&lt;h1&gt;THIS IS MY AMAZING PAGE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit of page content&lt;/p&gt;
</code></p>
