<h1>Biology</h1>
<p>Biology is life. Every form of life is made out of cells. There are 2 main types of cells: Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes. Prokaryotes are Cells have a very important thing called enzymes. Basically, enzymes break up or put together different chemicals. This is very important: Each type of enzyme can only deal with a specific type of chemical. They also need a specific environment. <b>Homeostatis</b> is the process that cells use to control things, like the pH level in the cell (see Chemistry for pH. Yes, Biology is just Chemistry). To do this, each cell has a <b>semi-permeable</b> membrane. Small things like oxygen and water can just pass through the membrane, but larger things need to be let through a sort of door that allows things in and out. Naturally, things flow from a place of higher concentration to a place of lower concentration. Water can also flow to a place of higher solute concentration. To flow the other way, you need energy. This energy is called ATP.</p>
<p>How do cells get ATP? Well, animals eat food, which gives them sugar, which has glucose, which added to oxygen can be converted into water, carbon dioxide and ATP. Plants, however, have things called Chloroplasts. Inside the Chloroplast, there's Chlorophyll. These reflect green light (so plants are green) and absorb red and blue light. This light is used to break down water and get carbon dioxide that can be converted to glucose.</p>
<h2>Evolution:</h2>
<p>Charles darwin invented natural selection (but he actually had lots of help from Wallace). The theory is simple. Animals better adapted to new change are going to survive and produce offspring. The variations in animals can happen naturally by accident.</p>
