    <h2>Chemistry Overview</h2>
    <p>Chemistry is the study of elements and their interactions. Everything is composed of atoms, which consist of protons (positive), electrons (negative), and neutrons (neutral). The number of protons equals the number of electrons in a neutral atom.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the Periodic Table</h2>
    <p>The periodic table organizes elements into groups (columns) and periods (rows):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Groups</strong>: Elements in the same group share similar properties due to having the same number of valence electrons (electrons in the outermost shell). For example, Group 1 elements (e.g., Lithium, Sodium, Potassium) are highly reactive with water, except for Hydrogen.</li>
        <li><strong>Periods</strong>: Elements in the same period have the same number of electron shells.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Isotopes are variants of elements with different numbers of neutrons, often making them unstable and highly reactive.</p>

    <h2>Chemical Bonds</h2>
    <p>Chemical bonds hold atoms together. The main types are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ionic Bonds</strong>: Form when one atom donates an electron to another, creating oppositely charged ions (cations: positive; anions: negative). For example, Sodium (Na) donates an electron to Chlorine (Cl), forming NaCl (table salt).</li>
        <li><strong>Covalent Bonds</strong>: Occur when atoms share electrons. Polar covalent bonds involve unequal sharing (e.g., water, where Oxygen attracts Hydrogen’s electrons). Non-polar covalent bonds involve equal sharing (e.g., O₂).</li>
        <li><strong>Metallic Bonds</strong>: Found in metals, where electrons are shared in a "sea" of electrons, allowing conductivity and malleability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The pH Scale</h2>
    <p>The pH scale measures acidity or basicity, ranging from 0 (most acidic) to 14 (most basic), with 7 being neutral. Below is a linear representation of the pH scale with examples:</p>

    <div class="ph-scale">
        <div class="ph-marker" style="left: 0%;">0</div>
        <div class="ph-marker" style="left: 7.14%;">1</div>
        <div class="ph-marker" style="left: 14.29%;">2</div>

        <div class="ph-marker" style="left: 100%;">14</div>
    </div>
    <div class="ph-labels">

        <div>Stomach Acid</div>

<p>Some natural substances can be used as indicators to show pH level. I added baking soda to turmeric solution and it turns from yellow to a darker color, representing high pH. After adding lemon juice, it cancels and turns back to yellow, representing neutral pH.</p>

    <p><strong>Acids</strong>: Substances with a pH below 7, such as battery acid (pH 0), stomach acid (pH 1-2), vinegar (pH 2-3), and lemon juice (pH 2-3).</p>
    <p><strong>Bases</strong>: Substances with a pH above 7, including alkalis (soluble bases) like baking soda (pH 9), ammonia (pH 11), and drain cleaner (pH 14). Bases neutralize acids.</p>
    <p>Metals have free flowing electrons in a rigid base of protons .This means that they can conduct electricity. Many electric vehicles (EVs) use metals like copper and silver for conducting electricity</p>

<h2>Entropy</h2>
<p>Entropy is the "messiness" of things. For example, in a solid, everything is arranged very neatly. This means that the solid has low entropy. However, a gas has things messily moving around everywhere. A gas has high entropy. An example of entropy can be seen with a deck of cards:</p>
<p>The cards are thrown into the air and land on the ground. The neat organised deck has a low entropy, while the messy pile has a high entropy. It takes more energy to go from a state of high to low entropy (put all the cards back together) than the other way (throw the cards in the air)</p>
